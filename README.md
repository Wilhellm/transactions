# Amazon transactions joiner

When downloading transactions from Amazon's Seller Center, it's only possible to download a maximum of 600 at a time.

This project is a simple UNIX shell scripting exercise that will help me join all files into one.

The idea is to use this small script to learn about standard UNIX commands, stdin/stdout redirection and pipes.
